                            It's supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
                            Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious
                            If you say it loud enough you'll always sound precocious

                            Because I was afraid to speak when I was just a lad
                            Me father gave me nose a tweak, told me I was bad
                            But then one day I learned a word that saved me achin' nose
                            The biggest word you ever heard and this is how it goes
                            Oh, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
                            Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious
                            If you say it loud enough you'll always sound precocious

                            Um-dittle-ittl-um-dittle-I
                            Um-dittle-ittl-um-dittle-I

                            He traveled all around the world and everywhere he went
                            He'd use his word and all would say there goes a clever gent
                            When dukes or Maharajas pass the time of day with me
                            I say me special word and then they ask me out to tea (woo)

                            Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious

                            You know you can say it backwards which is
                            Dociousaliexpisticfragicalirupus
                            But that's going a bit too far, don't you think?
                            Indubitably
                            So when the cat has got your tongue there's no need for dismay (here-ye)
                            Just summon up this word and then you've got a lot to say
                            But better use it carefully or it could change your life
                            For example
                            Yes?
                            One night, I said it to me girl and now me girl's me wife
                            Oh, and a lovely thing she is, too
                            She's
